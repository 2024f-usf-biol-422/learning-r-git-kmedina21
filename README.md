This project is a way to apply what we learned in BIOL 422 so far and integrate them with each other to create a comprehensive Rmd file.
The data used in this project is one we have been working with throughout the semester so far.

## How to run the code.
1. Open the Report.Rmd file in RStudio.
2. Click on the "Knit" button at the top of the script.

## A.I. Disclosure
The code in this project was made and written with the help of ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot.
The prompts used for ChatGPT were:

1. "Using R programming language, write a code that writes a function that takes two arguments:
    1) a character string that is the path/name of a SNP dataset csv
    2) a character string that is a sample ID"
2. "Subset the main SNP dataset into a single-sample dataset, using function subset_snp_data"
3. "How to write into csv the code chunk below:  
    {r, subset data}
    subset_snp_data(dataset = snp_data, "SRR12433063")"
